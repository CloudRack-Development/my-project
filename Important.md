Working to date.

Make sure 


So far to date
- have added backend with api system to call tickets /api/tickets as well as a call to call products i.e domain/api/Products these products can be called
upon by discord bots and more but the main factor was to allow the front react site to allow easy calls of a working api to less the stress on sellix's
servers as well. The ideas behind this site is to make it open source and allow others to change frealy the things they would like.

this app currently if not mistaken should be run pretty easily with the following below

To run the whole project and install everything needed via npm and npx, including the backend server.js and frontend npm, you can follow these general steps:

1. Clone the project repository from a version control system like GitLab, GitHub, or Bitbucket.

2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.

3. Install backend dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```
4. Start the backend server:
```bash
npm start
```
5. Open a new terminal window/tab.

6. Navigate to the frontend directory:

```bash
cd ../frontend
```

7. Install frontend dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

8. Start the frontend development server:
```bash
npm start
```
These steps will install the necessary dependencies for both the backend and frontend,
and then start the servers for both components. Make sure to replace backend and frontend with the actual names of your backend and frontend directories,
if they are different. Also, ensure that your backend and frontend scripts for starting the servers are correctly configured in your package.json files.
