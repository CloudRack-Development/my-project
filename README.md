About Me
I am the current developer of this project, I enjoy gaming and listening to music on the side.

I'm slowly working on becoming a full stack developer with front/backend in many coding languages over time.

I run a store to sell Fallout 76 on the side of my daily work.

Any donations are welcome via ETH. My address can be located below:
